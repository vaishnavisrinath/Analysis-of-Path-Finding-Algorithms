Analysis of following path-finding algorithms for various input sizes:

1)BFS

2)DFS

3)A*

4)Dijkstra's

The implementations of the path-finding algorithms are done in Python. Each algorithm is tested on various input sizes and different graph types to ensure a comprehensive comparison. A graph is plotted for each type of input to compare their performance
